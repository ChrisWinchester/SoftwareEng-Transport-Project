    <h5>Public Transport Route Finder (PTRF) is a mobile application
      with an active Internet connection, which can be used by people
      living in many different cities all over the world. Main aim of
      the application is to suggest the available public transport routes
      between two given points in a city. Depending on the means of public
      transport available in a city, it can suggest different kinds of
      transport types including railway, land vehicles (city busses,
      private buses, etc.) and sea transport. If the stations (bus stops, etc.)
      of two consecutive vehicles to be used are within walking distance, the system
      should also show the shortest path to be walked to reach the next station on
      the route. It should also be possible to add new public transport types and
      update the existing ones in each city.
      The use case to be implemented is showing the available transport routes
      between two points chosen by the user.</h5>
